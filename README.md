# Application form using Tkinter
Micro Project 3rd Sem

The application developed in this project is a form fillup system for an organisation (college in this case).

## How the Application works:
1. `GUI Interface(Main).y` is the driver program and the GUI for this application.
2. Filling up the form and pressing submit would create a record in `p.csv` file.
3. Additional Feature: An prediction algorithm is also built in the application that analyse the details of the applicant and predicts their success of getting in the organisation.

## Repo Contents:
- `GUI Interface(Main).py` - Main Driving Program of the application
- `prediction.py` - Prediction Algorithm
- `Simple LR` - The model that predicts the success rate
- `p.csv` - data of applicants
